Draw It or Lose It is loosely similar to the 1980s television game Win, Lose or Draw, where teams compete to guess what is being drawn. Rather than a player drawing images on an easel to help team members guess the puzzle (a phrase, title, or thing), the application will render images from a large library of stock drawings as clues. A game consists of four rounds of play lasting one minute each. Drawings are rendered at a steady rate and are fully complete at the 30-second mark. If the team does not guess the puzzle before time expires, the remaining teams have an opportunity to offer one guess each to solve the puzzle with a 15-second time limit.

In general, when developing software for a client, it is important to carefully consider their needs and requirements. This often involves gathering information about the client and their business, as well as understanding the specific goals and objectives of the software project. The client may provide specific requirements for the software, such as specific features or functionality, or they may leave it up to the development team to come up with a design that meets their needs.

One way to document the client's requirements and the design of the software is to create a design document. This document can include information such as the overall goals and objectives of the software, the target audience and user needs, the specific features and functionality of the software, and any technical or logistical constraints that must be considered.

Working through a design document can be helpful in the development process because it provides a clear roadmap for the team to follow. It can also help to ensure that the software meets the needs of the client and the users.

When designing software, it is important to consider the needs of the users because the ultimate goal of the software is to meet their needs and solve their problems. This involves understanding their goals, motivations, and pain points, and designing the software in a way that addresses these needs.

There are many different techniques and strategies that can be used to analyze and design a software application. Some common approaches include user-centered design, which focuses on understanding and meeting the needs of the users, and agile development, which emphasizes flexibility and rapid iteration. Other techniques that may be useful in the design process include prototyping, usability testing, and user research.
